Nano Foundation has been founded in 2015, as a computer science and research foundation. We are currently working on a computer operating system called __NanOS__. 

Nano Foundation is named after [NanOS](https://github.com/prp-e/NanOS), a simple, 32-bit operating system written by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://github.com/prp-e), the creator of [JabirOS](http://jabirproject.org).

## Brief History
After Muhammadreza Haghiri made his own little 16-bit boot sector, simply called [my16bitkernel](https://github.com/prp-e/my16bitkernel), decided to write a complete operating system from scratch. __NanOS__ called _Tinix_ first, but it's been renamed to __NanOS__ for copyright issues.
