        <title>Hello, World!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings to all people interested in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nano Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; founded as a research foundation, and we do research on operating systems. Operating systems are the most important part of a working computer. You may ask why? Because an operating system lets user use hardware, and also run other software. An operating system can control one or more computer, and so on. We started development of a simple and fast operating system called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nano-foundation/NanOS&quot;&gt;NanOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in 2015, as a fun project, but later we decided to make it a complete and usable operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
