title: Nano foundation and JabirTech merged
---
Greetings. It's time to tell all people who followed us in this period, that Nano Foundation is going to be merged with [Jabir Project](http://jabirproject.org), because we've launched a 32 bit operating system project at __Jabir Project__ and now we want to work together.

Regards.

Muhammadreza Haghiri.
