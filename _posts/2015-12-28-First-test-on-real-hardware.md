This is the firs time we tested [NanOS](https://github.com/nano-foundation/NanOS) on real hardware. Operating system booted using a USB flash drive. The test device was a __Lenovo G510__ laptop. If you want to test this operating system on your real device, just do these steps:

```
   sudo dd if=NanOS.iso of=/dev/sdX
```

Then, plug drive and then reboot your system.
